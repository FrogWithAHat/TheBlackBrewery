## Ascomoid
> What appears to be an enormous puffball begins to move on its own, rolling along at a frantic pace. Constant streams of spores leak from countless openings in the fungal flesh, leaving a haze in the air.

- **Spores (Ex)** Once per round, as a free action, an ascomoid
can release a jet of deadly spores in a 30-foot line. Upon impacting a solid surface, such as a wall or creature, the
jet billows out into a cloud of spores that  lls a 10-foot- radius area. This cloud lasts for 1 round before dispersing. Any creature in the cloud inhales ascomoid poison (save Fort DC 16, frequency 1 round [7], e ect 1 Con damage,
cure 1 save). Even if the save succeeds, creatures inside the cloud are nauseated as long as they remain in the cloud. Ascomoids are immune to ascomoid spores. The save DC is Constitution-based.
