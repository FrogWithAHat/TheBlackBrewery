Welcome, traveler. Sit and tell us of what you have seen -- the unheard of monsters, which slither and bite. Tell us of the wondrous items and and artifacts you have found, their mysteries yet to be unlocked --

## Homebrew D&D made easy
`The Homebrewery` makes the creation and sharing of authentic-looking D&D (3.5E, 4E and 5E) homebrews easy. It uses [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and a little CSS magic to make your brews come to life.

**Try it!** Simply edit the text on the left and watch it *update live* on the right.

Of course, a document isn't of much help if it can't be printed out. Luckily, exporting PDFs with `The Homebrewery` is very straightforward:
- **Mac**: &#8984;-Shift-E.
- **Windows**: Ctrl-Shift-E.

## Markdown
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is used to generate the HTML styled by `The Homebrewery`. If Markdown proves insufficient for your needs, you can use a limited subset of HTML to augment your Markdown.

- **Headers**: Headers are denoted with pound signs, the more signs, the smaller the header. Follow the last pound with a space and the text of your header.
- **Emphasis**: Emphasis is shown with asterisks on either side of a word or phrase -- single asterisks for *italic*, double asterisks for **bold**.
- **Small caps** - use backticks to render `small caps`.
- **Links**: Links are created with square brackets (around the text of the link) followed directly with parentheses and the url inside.
- **Lists**: Undordered lists are made with dashes and can be nested arbitrarily with two spaces. Ordered lists use a number instead of a dash.
- **Images:** Images use the same format as links, but are prefixed with an exclamation point (!). Currently images must be hosted on a third-party site (imgur, etc.) or provided with an absolute filepath.
- **Column and page breaks** are left to the author. To start a new page, use a backslash followed by the word *page*. Use a backslash followed by the word *col* to break to the next column.
- **Fences** are block elements. Indicate sidebars, notes and tables with triple backticks, followed by the name of the block element. Close the block with three more backticks.
